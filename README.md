## Debuggerr

#### Live Debugging Tool for Production Sites
This Node.js module is a tool for live debugging of production websites. It allows you to remotely connect to a running Node.js application and set breakpoints in your JavaScript code, just like you would do in a local development environment. This can be very helpful in debugging production issues that are difficult or impossible to reproduce in a development environment.

#### Features
- Remotely debug production applications in real-time
- Set breakpoints in your code to catch issues that are difficult to reproduce
- Supports multiple debug sessions at the same time
- Integrates with the Node.js Debugger API for powerful debugging capabilities

#### Limitations
- The tool is intended for use in development or staging environments only. Running the debugger on a production environment can have serious security implications.
- Debugging live production sites can cause performance issues and may impact user experience. 
- Use with caution and only when necessary.

#### Conclusion

This Live Debugging Tool for Production Sites can be a valuable tool for developers who need to debug issues in production environments. By allowing remote debugging of running applications, it can help diagnose and fix issues that are difficult or impossible to reproduce in a development environment. However, it's important to use the tool with caution and only in non-production environments to minimize potential security and performance risks.
